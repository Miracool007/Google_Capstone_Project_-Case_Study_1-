Performing analysis for bike-sharing company in other to help them attract more rides
## Overview
Cyclistic is a bike sharing program which features more than 5,800 bikes and 600 docking stations. It offers reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making it more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can't use a standard two-wheeled bike.
Previously, Cyclistic's marketing strategy tried to build the general awareness and appeal to broad consumers. It has flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Those who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders while those who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
As a data analyst, I have tasked with analysing their data and proffer recommendations aimed at converting casual users to annual member.
For my analysis, I would be making use of their data for the first quarter of the year (January to March, 2021).
## Project Findings
1. Members had the most rides at 70% of the total rides
2. The most popular bike type for both riders was the classic bike
3. Sundays was the most popular weekday for both riders. Members used the bikes equally throughout the week with a slight increase in Wednesdays.
   Casual riders used the bikes equally across the week but ride the most on weekends particularly on Saturdays.
4. The month of March happen to be the busiets in the first quarter.
### Recommendations
1. Emphasis should be made on the benefits of being registered as an annual member, including periodic discount for casual members.
2. Have existing members to share their stories about how using Cyclistic's system has changed their life, to create a sense of community, offer a discount if they do so    this will help encourage new riders to join the program.
3. Personalize discounts and show perks in the membership program based on their preferences and riding habits.
